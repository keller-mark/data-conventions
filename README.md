Specific storage conventions on top of more general standard formats.

Focused on single-cell use cases and compatibility with [Vitessce](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce).

- Data processing utilities conforming to these conventions can be found within the `data_utils` module of [vitessce-python](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python).
- `cellxgene` relies on AnnData objects conforming to [specific conventions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/blob/main/schema/3.0.0/schema.md#general-requirements)
